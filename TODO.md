# ✅ TODO / Milestones

> Open work only: remove an item when it ships — its release note lands in CHANGELOG.md automatically (release-please). See [README.md](README.md) for context and [docs/](docs/) for the detailed design behind each item.

> Shipped work is recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and on the [Releases page](https://github.com/GreenMachine582/greentechhub-fastapi/releases) — this file only tracks what's still open.

## 🗺️ Milestones

### v1.0 — Validated in production
- [ ] BottleBot's retrofit fully on it
- [ ] PyFinBot's greenfield build fully on it

## 🔄 Migration Tracking

### BottleBot
- [ ] Adopt `register_auth`, if/when BottleBot grows a login (lowest priority)
- [ ] Replace watchlist's `_watchlist_page_params`/`_next_url` with `query.page_params`/`query.next_page_url` (v0.7)

### PyFinBot
- [ ] Register everything from `greentechhub-fastapi` from the start (greenfield)
- [ ] Follow-up pass on the PyFinBot web interface brief — it currently references `greentechhub-core`'s auth adapter directly rather than this package

### Market Watch (planned)
- [ ] Not started — builds on this from day one, same as PyFinBot
